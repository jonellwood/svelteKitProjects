		<h1>Word Resume Clone</h1>
		<p>
			While realizing an online resume is critical for obtaining employment these days I decided I
			wanted to to have a webpage that would serve as a resume - but was also a challenge to build.
			I decided on trying to make a web page that looks like a Word Document.
		</p>

		<p>
			My goals were simple: - It should look as close to a Word Document as possible. - The HTML
			should be semantically correct. - It should meet all requirements for a11y. - It should also
			have all the information a potential employer might need. i.e. it needs to be a current and
			functional resume.
		</p>
		<img src={WordResumeClone} alt="word Clone" width="40%" />
		<p>
			I started by researching what hex values Office 365 Word used which was fairly easy to find.
			(Firefox dev tools color grab tool made this very easy) Then I started laying out the HTML and
			CSS to make the document look as close to a screenshot of Word in the web as I could. The only
			JavaScript I added was a little date function to update the "Last Saved' bit in the very top.
			The downside to doing this is that there is a bit of a flash when moving between pages as it
			updates. Since I used only HTML (and not a component based framework - although I really wish
			I had) each page is a separate file with LOADS of repeated code. I had a ton of fun creating
			the little AutoSave toggle, sourcing the icons, and even creating the Nav menu. I figured
			since Word has a "references" menu option I might as well make that a page.... and it just
			kind of grew from there.
		</p>
		<p>
			I attempted to the make the ribbon that sits below the menu but man oh man was that tough! I
			think if subgrid was supported across all modern browsers it might be an easier task. I
			snagged a screenshot of the ribbon and loaded it in as an image but felt like that was
			cheating. I have not given up on the ribbon.... but we'll see. Things left to do as of this
			writing: - Make the document responsive. It look awful on mobile. - Make the ribbon for below
			the menu. - Consider refactoring into a React or Svelte app to take advantage of components
			UPDATE: Did refactor to Svelte. Took about 2 1/2 hours and wow was it worth it!
